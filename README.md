My first few file uploads are intended as boilerplate for Electron apps and are not intended to be changed. Later uploads will be used for changes as required,
as well as for new projects in other programming languages.  I am a complete noob with respect to Github and thus expect a rather steep learning curve, but that's
how it goes. I hope I can ge a dark theme for this as I hate white backgrounds, they destroy my eyes, even with my monitor brightness levels turned all the way down.
